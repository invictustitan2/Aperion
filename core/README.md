# Aperion Portal

The master site for all my projects.

## Projects
- **Cavern of Evil: 2055**  
  A CLI-based text game exploring a neon-lit labyrinth.

- **Car Tracker**  
  A tracking app for vehicles.

## Structure
- `/index.html`: Main entry point for the portal.
- `/projects/`: All project folders, fully isolated.
- `/static/`: (Optional) CSS and JS for the index page.

## Contributing
- Projects are kept in separate folders.
- Changes to individual projects should happen in their own repo or folder.

## Purpose
Aperion is the portal; each project is a world.
